This repository contains the code and resources for a CSS Tailwind tutorial, based Dave Gray's YouTube video. 

In this tutorial, I learnt how to use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, to rapidly build modern and responsive user interfaces. The tutorial covers various aspects of Tailwind CSS, including installation, configuration, and usage of its utility classes.
